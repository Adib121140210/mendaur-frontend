# 🎯 QUICK BRIEF FOR FRONTEND TEAM (2 min read)

**What:** New Point System is ready  
**Who:** Frontend team needs to build UI  
**When:** Start now  
**Status:** Backend complete ✅

---

## 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

### The Backend Built:
✅ Point tracking database  
✅ 6 API endpoints for point data  
✅ Integration with deposits (auto-award points)  
✅ Integration with redemptions (auto-deduct points)  

### What You Need To Build:
- Display user's total points
- Show point history with filters
- Show point breakdown (where $ came from)
- Show redemption history
- Update points after actions

---

## 📊 THE 6 ENDPOINTS

| Endpoint | Purpose | Returns |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GET /api/user/{id}/poin` | User points + recent history | User data + transactions |
| `GET /api/poin/history` | All user transactions | Paginated list |
| `GET /api/user/{id}/redeem-history` | Product redemptions | Redemption list |
| `GET /api/user/{id}/poin/statistics` | Point stats | Earned/spent breakdown |
| `GET /api/poin/breakdown/{id}` | Where points came from | Earnings & spending |
| `POST /api/poin/bonus` | Award bonus (admin) | Confirmation |

---

## 🎨 COMPONENTS TO BUILD

1. **Point Card** - Show total points big & bold
2. **History Page** - List transactions with dates
3. **Breakdown Chart** - Pie/bar showing sources
4. **Redemption List** - Show past redemptions
5. **Point Dashboard** - Master view combining all

## 🔗 INTEGRATION POINTS

### When User Deposits Waste:
- Admin approves → Points awarded automatically
- Show point breakdown to user
- Update points display

### When User Redeems Product:
- Check if enough points (backend validates)
- If not enough → Show error
- If enough → Points deducted automatically
- Show confirmation with new balance

## 📝 API RESPONSE FORMAT

All responses are JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // actual data here
  }
}
```

Or on error:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

---

## ✅ TESTING

1. Open Postman
2. Test each endpoint with a real user ID
3. Check response format matches examples
4. Then build UI components

## 🎯 PRIORITY

1. Point display (most important - users see this)
2. History list (users want to know what happened)
3. Breakdown chart (nice to have)
4. Redemption history (reference)
